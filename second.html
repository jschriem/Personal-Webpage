  <p>I am currently a software engineering student in my second year at the University of Victoria with an interest in web design, online security, and all things tech.</p>

  <p>In class, I have constructed programs in Python, C and Java and used the Linux OS to develop software. </p>
  <p>Outside of school, I have built websites using HTML and CSS, created apps using XML and Java, and attended programming competetions such as HACK Uvic (Major League Hacking), and Battle Snake (BCâ€™s largest programming competition)</p>
