1) After the call requesting memory (line 221), checking the result with an if statement immediately afterwards to ensure system has not run out of memory and that result is not NULL.

2)Using typecasting (line 221) to ensure that the returned pointer is the type that we are using, rather than a generic void pointer.

3)Another possible fix for #1, is to use the xmalloc() non-standard function which when the call fails to allocate memory, xmalloc() terminates the program and prints an error message to stderr automatically.

4)Line 221 allocates the memory, while line 230 frees that memory. I added extra comments such as //allocate1 and //free1 to keep track of memory usage to avoid a memory leak.

5)Possible future error, MAX_MSG_SIZE has been set to 200, but in the future, this c file could be used for message sizes greater than 200, not proper to make assumptions about input sizes, as we want our code to be as flexible as possible.
